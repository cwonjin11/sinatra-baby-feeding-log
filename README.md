# Sinatra Baby Feeding Log

A simple Sinatra-powered web application created to track your baby feeding logs.

This app could be used for:
* adding/editing multiple babies with names and ages
* tracking babies' logs by feeding types, times and amount.
* updating babies' logs 

This project was created as part of the [Flatiron School's Online Web Developer program](https://flatiron-school.com).

## Install Instructions

Visit [Sinatra Baby Feeding Log](https://.com/) to begin using the app.

Alternatively, clone this repo, run `bundle install`, `rake db:migrate`, and then run `shotgun`.

For added security when cloning the repo, generate your own session secret:

1. Comment out the current session_secret in the Application Controller and un-comment the `ENV.fetch('SESSION_SECRET')`.
2. Create a new .env file by running `touch .env` in your terminal
3. Use the [session_secret_generator gem](https://github.com/DakotaLMartinez/session_secret_generator), included in this project's Gemfile, by running `generate_secret` in the terminal.
4. Copy the secret from your terminal output and paste into your `.env` file locally. It should look something like this in your .env file:

`SESSION_SECRET=8ad90be1a5a9aaaf04a0a99d8efb42c825f16b8fef603f65b600c91d66a17bdd520099130ed70669409a524a97c8f62e9434a0ad102624f9bcff0832e3c2f568`

**NOTE** Don't use this secret!!! The secret you use should be kept private and out of version control or anywhere else publicly accessible.
